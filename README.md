# **Coding and Data Science Project**


As part of my BIO319 module during my third year studying Biology at Queen Mary University of London, I learnt the fundamental coding principles, tidying and foramtting data as well as creating informative visualisations.

## Data
The data used in this project was provided by Queen Mary and some datasets were sourced from `dung_beetles.csv`. It contains monthly counts of various beetle species, detailing their genus and species. The dataset is of moderate size, containing columns for months and species counts. Key preprocessing steps included:
- Converting column names to lowercase.
- Removing unnecessary columns.
- Renaming certain columns for consistency.
- Reshaping the data for easier analysis.
- Splitting species names into genus and species components.

## Methodology
The analysis and visualization process involved several key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Standardized column names, removed irrelevant columns, and reshaped the dataset.
2. **Grouping and Summarizing Data**: Calculated total beetle counts for each month and analyzed the distribution of species.
3. **Visualization Techniques**: Utilized `ggplot2` for creating various plots and `patchwork` for arranging multiple plots together. Additionally, `RColorBrewer` was used to enhance color schemes in the visualizations.

The R packages used in this project include:
- `tidyverse`: For data manipulation and visualization.
- `RColorBrewer`: For color palettes.
- `patchwork`: For combining multiple plots.

## I can also add a link to a [folder](./my_plots)

If I want the link in normal text that's [fine](./Images_for_Git), too.

### There are different header levels

I can have text in **bold** or in *italics*. 
If I want I can even add a table!
